This table contains new estimates for health insurance coverage status by employment status in 2010.<br /><br />

Explanation of Symbols:<ol>
<li>An ''**'' entry in the margin of error column indicates that either no sample observations or too few sample observations were available to compute a standard error and thus the margin of error. A statistical test is not appropriate.</li>
<li>An ''-'' entry in the estimate column indicates that either no sample observations or too few sample observations were available to compute an estimate, or a ratio of medians cannot be calculated because one or both of the median estimates falls in the lowest interval or upper interval of an open-ended distribution.</li>
<li>An ''-'' following a median estimate means the median falls in the lowest interval of an open-ended distribution.</li>
<li>An ''+'' following a median estimate means the median falls in the upper interval of an open-ended distribution.</li>
<li>An ''***'' entry in the margin of error column indicates that the median falls in the lowest interval or upper interval of an open-ended distribution. A statistical test is not appropriate.</li>
<li>An ''*****'' entry in the margin of error column indicates that the estimate is controlled. A statistical test for sampling variability is not appropriate. </li>
<li>An ''N'' entry in the estimate and margin of error columns indicates that data for this geographic area cannot be displayed because the number of sample cases is too small.</li>
<li>An ''(X)'' means that the estimate is not applicable or not available.</li></ol><br /><br />

The Census Bureau introduced an improved sequence of labor force questions in the 2008 ACS questionnaire.  Accordingly, we recommend using caution when making labor force data comparisons from 2008 or later with data from prior years.  For more information on these questions and their evaluation in the 2006 ACS Content Test, see the "Evaluation Report Covering Employment Status" at <a href="http://www.census.gov/acs/www/Downloads/methodology/content_test/P6a_Employment_Status.pdf">http://www.census.gov/acs/www/Downloads/methodology/content_test/P6a_Employment_Status.pdf</a>, and the "Evaluation Report Covering Weeks Worked" at <a href="http://www.census.gov/acs/www/Downloads/methodology/content_test/P6b_Weeks_Worked_Final_Report.pdf">http://www.census.gov/acs/www/Downloads/methodology/content_test/P6b_Weeks_Worked_Final_Report.pdf</a>.

Industry codes are 4-digit codes and are based on the North American Industry Classification System 2007. The Industry categories adhere to the guidelines issued in Clarification Memorandum No. 2, "NAICS Alternate Aggregation Structure for Use By U.S. Statistical Agencies," issued by the Office of Management and Budget.<br /><br />

Employment and unemployment estimates may vary from the official labor force data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics because of differences in survey design and data collection. For guidance on differences in employment and unemployment estimates from different sources go to <a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/laborfor/laborguidance082504.html">Labor Force Guidance</a>.<br /><br />

Selected earnings and income data are not available for certain geographic areas due to problems with group quarters data collection and imputation. See the <a href="http://www.census.gov/acs/www/data_documentation/user_notes/">ACS User Notes</a> for details.<br /><br />

Logical coverage edits applying a rules-based assignment of Medicaid, Medicare and military health coverage were added as of 2009 -- please see <a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/hlthins/publications/coverage_edits_final.pdf">http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/hlthins/publications/coverage_edits_final.pdf</a> for more details.  The corresponding 2008 data table in American FactFinder does not incorporate these edits and is therefore not comparable to this table in 2009 or 2010.  Select geographies of 2008 data comparable to the 2009 and 2010 tables are accessible at <a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/hlthins/data/acs/2008/re-run.html">http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/hlthins/data/acs/2008/re-run.html</a>.<br /><br />

While the 2010 American Community Survey (ACS) data generally reflect the December 2009 Office of Management and Budget (OMB) definitions of metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas; in certain instances the names, codes, and boundaries of the principal cities shown in ACS tables may differ from the OMB definitions due to differences in the effective dates of the geographic entities.<br /><br />

There were changes in the edit between 2009 and 2010 regarding Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and Social Security.  The changes in the edit loosened restrictions on disability requirements for receipt of SSI resulting in an increase in the total number of SSI recipients in the American Community Survey.  The changes also loosened restrictions on possible reported monthly amounts in Social Security income resulting in higher Social Security aggregate amounts.  These results more closely match administrative counts compiled by the Social Security Administration.<br /><br />

Data are based on a sample and are subject to sampling variability. The degree of uncertainty for an estimate arising from sampling variability is represented through the use of a margin of error. The value shown here is the 90 percent margin of error. The margin of error can be interpreted roughly as providing a 90 percent probability that the interval defined by the estimate minus the margin of error and the estimate plus the margin of error (the lower and upper confidence bounds) contains the true value. In addition to sampling variability, the ACS estimates are subject to nonsampling error (for a discussion of nonsampling variability, see <a href="http://www.census.gov/acs/www/data_documentation/documentation_main/">Accuracy of the Data</a>).  The effect of nonsampling error is not represented in these tables.<br /><br />

Supporting documentation on code lists, subject definitions, data accuracy, and statistical testing can be found on the American Community Survey website in the <a href="http://www.census.gov/acs/www/data_documentation/documentation_main/#doc2010">Data and Documentation</a> section.<br /><br />

Sample size and data quality measures (including coverage rates, allocation rates, and response rates) can be found on the American Community Survey website in the <a href="http://www.census.gov/acs/www/methodology/sample_size_and_data_quality/">Methodology</a> section.<br /><br />

The health insurance coverage category names were modified in 2010.  See <a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/hlthins/methodology/definitions/acs.html">ACS Health Insurance Definitions</a> for a list of the insurance type definitions.<br /><br />

The 2010 Census occupation codes were updated in accordance with the 2010 revision of the Standard Occupational Classification (SOC). Occupation data from 2010 are not strictly comparable to data from prior years. For more information on the Census occupation code changes, please visit our website at <a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/ioindex/">http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/ioindex/</a>.<br /><br />

The methodology for calculating median income and median earnings changed between 2008 and 2009. Medians over $75,000 were most likely affected. The underlying income and earning distribution now uses $2,500 increments up to $250,000 for households, non-family households, families, and individuals and employs a linear interpolation method for median calculations. Before 2009 the highest income category was $200,000 for households, families and non-family households ($100,000 for individuals) and portions of the income and earnings distribution contained intervals wider than $2,500.  Those cases used a Pareto Interpolation Method.<br /><br />

An * indicates that the estimate is significantly different (at a 90% confidence level) than the estimate from the most current year.  A "c" indicates the estimates for that year and the current year are both controlled; a statistical test is not appropriate.<br /><br />

Although the American Community Survey (ACS) produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates, for 2010, the 2010 Census provides the <a href="http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/help/jsf/pages/metadata.xhtml?lang=en&type=program&id=program.en.DEC">official counts of the population and housing units for the nation, states, counties, cities and towns</a>.<br /><br />

Estimates of urban and rural population, housing units, and characteristics reflect boundaries of urban areas defined based on Census 2000 data. Boundaries for urban areas have not been updated since Census 2000. As a result, data for urban and rural areas from the ACS do not necessarily reflect the results of ongoing urbanization.<br /><br />
